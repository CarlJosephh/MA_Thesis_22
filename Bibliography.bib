@article{Rodriguez.2010,
 abstract = {In the machine learning field, the performance of a classifier is usually measured in terms of prediction error. In most real-world problems, the error cannot be exactly calculated and it must be estimated. Therefore, it is important to choose an appropriate estimator of the error. This paper analyzes the statistical properties, bias and variance, of the kappa-fold cross-validation classification error estimator (kappa-cv). Our main contribution is a novel theoretical decomposition of the variance of the kappa-cv considering its sources of variance: sensitivity to changes in the training set and sensitivity to changes in the folds. The paper also compares the bias and variance of the estimator for different values of kappa. The experimental study has been performed in artificial domains because they allow the exact computation of the implied quantities and we can rigorously specify the conditions of experimentation. The experimentation has been performed for two classifiers (naive Bayes and nearest neighbor), different numbers of folds, sample sizes, and training sets coming from assorted probability distributions. We conclude by including some practical recommendation on the use of kappa-fold cross validation.},

abstract = {Classification of remotely sensed imagery for land-cover mapping purposes has attracted significant attention from researchers and practitioners. Numerous studies conducted over several decades have investigated a broad array of input data and classification methods. However, this vast assemblage of research results has not been synthesized to provide coherent guidance on the relative performance of different classification processes for generating land cover products. To address this problem, we completed a statistical meta-analysis of the past 15years of research on supervised per-pixel image classification published in five high-impact remote sensing journals. The two general factors evaluated were classification algorithms and input data manipulation as these are factors that can be controlled by analysts to improve classification accuracy. The meta-analysis revealed that inclusion of texture information yielded the greatest improvement in overall accuracy of land-cover classification with an average increase of 12.1\%. This increase in accuracy can be attributed to the additional spatial context information provided by including texture. Inclusion of ancillary data, multi-angle and time images also provided significant improvement in classification overall accuracy, with 8.5\%, 8.0\%, and 6.9\% of average improvements, respectively. In contrast, other manipulation of spectral information such as index creation (e.g. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and feature extraction (e.g. Principal Components Analysis) offered much smaller improvements in accuracy. In terms of classification algorithms, support vector machines achieved the greatest accuracy, followed by neural network methods. The random forest classifier performed considerably better than the traditional decision tree classifier. Maximum likelihood classifiers, often used as benchmarking algorithms, offered low accuracy. Our findings will help guide practitioners to decide which classification to implement and also provide direction to researchers regarding comparative studies that will further solidify our understanding of different classification processes. However, these general guidelines do not preclude an analyst from incorporating personal preferences or considering specific algorithmic benefits that may be pertinent to a particular application.}

 abstract = {Effective mapping and monitoring of soil moisture content (SMC) in space and time is an expected application of remote sensing for agricultural development and drought mitigation, particularly in the context of global climate change impact, given that agricultural drought is occurring more frequently and severely worldwide. This study aims to develop a regional algorithm for estimating SMC by using Landsat 8 (L8) imagery, based on analyses of the response of soil reflectance, by corresponding L8 bands with the change of SMC from dry to saturated states, in all 103 soil samples taken in the central region of Vietnam. The L8 spectral band ratio of the near-infrared band (NIR: 850--880 nm, band 5) versus the short-wave infrared 2 band (SWIR2: 2110 to 2290 nm, band 7) shows the strongest correlation to SMC by a logarithm function (R2 = 0.73 and the root mean square error, RMSE ~ 12{\%}) demonstrating the high applicability of this band ratio for estimating SMC. The resultant maps of SMC estimated from the L8 images were acquired over the northern part of the Central Highlands of Vietnam in March 2015 and March 2016 showed an agreement with the pattern of severe droughts that occurred in the region. Further discussions on the relationship between the estimated SMC and the satellite-based retrieved drought index, the Normal Different Drought Index, from the L8 image acquired in March 2016, showed a strong correlation between these two variables within an area with less than 20{\%} dense vegetation (R2 = 0.78 to 0.95), and co-confirms the bad effect of drought on almost all areas of the northern part of the Central Highlands of Vietnam. Directly estimating SMC from L8 imagery provides more information for irrigation management and better drought mitigation than by using the remotely sensed drought index. Further investigations on various soil types and optical sensors (i.e., Sentinel 2A, 2B) need to be carried out, to extend and promote the applicability of the prosed algorithm, towards better serving agricultural management and drought mitigation.},

Yet, the separation of bare soil and other land cover types using remote sensing techniques remains a significant challenge. There are several remote sensing-based spectral indices for barren detection, but their effectiveness varies depending on land cover patterns and climate conditions. Within this research, we introduced a modified bare soil index (MBI) using shortwave infrared (SWIR) and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths derived from Landsat 8 (OLI---Operational Land Imager). The proposed bare soil index was tested in two different bare soil patterns in Thailand and Vietnam, where there are large areas of bare soil during the agricultural fallow period, obstructing the separation between bare soil and urban areas. Bare soil extracted from the MBI achieved higher overall accuracy of about 98{\%} and a kappa coefficient over 0.96, compared to bare soil index (BSI), normalized different bare soil index (NDBaI), and dry bare soil index (DBSI). The results also revealed that MBI considerably contributes to the accuracy of land cover classification. We suggest using the MBI for bare soil detection in tropical climatic regions.},

 abstract = {The number of trees T in the random forest (RF) algorithm for supervised learning has to be set by the user. It is controversial whether T should simply be set to the largest computationally manageable value or whether a smaller T may in some cases be better. While the principle underlying bagging is that more trees are better, in practice the classification error rate sometimes reaches a minimum before increasing again for increasing number of trees. The goal of this paper is four-fold: (i) providing theoretical results showing that the expected error rate may be a non-monotonous function of the number of trees and explaining under which circumstances this happens; (ii) providing theoretical results showing that such non-monotonous patterns cannot be observed for other performance measures such as the Brier score and the logarithmic loss (for classification) and the mean squared error (for regression); (iii) illustrating the extent of the problem through an application to a large number (n = 306) of datasets from the public database OpenML; (iv) finally arguing in favor of setting it to a computationally feasible large number, depending on convergence properties of the desired performance measure.

@article{Randremanana.2021,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Following the first detection of SARS-CoV-2 in passengers arriving from Europe on 19 March 2020, Madagascar took several mitigation measures to limit the spread of the virus in the country.

METHODS

Nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs were collected from travellers to Madagascar, suspected SARS-CoV-2 cases and contact of confirmed cases. Swabs were tested at the national reference laboratory using real-time RT-PCR. Data collected from patients were entered in an electronic database for subsequent statistical analysis. All distribution of laboratory-confirmed cases were mapped, and six genomes of viruses were fully sequenced.

RESULTS

Overall, 26,415 individuals were tested for SARS-CoV-2 between 18 March and 18 September 2020, of whom 21.0{\%} (5,553/26,145) returned positive. Among laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, the median age was 39~years (IQR: 28-52), and 56.6{\%} (3,311/5,553) were asymptomatic at the time of sampling. The probability of testing positive increased with age with the highest adjusted odds ratio of 2.2 [95{\%} CI: 1.9-2.5] for individuals aged 49~years and more. Viral strains sequenced belong to clades 19A, 20A and 20B indicative of several independent introduction of viruses.

CONCLUSIONS

Our study describes the first wave of the COVID-19 in Madagascar. Despite early strategies in place Madagascar could not avoid the introduction and spread of the virus. More studies are needed to estimate the true burden of disease and make public health recommendations for a better preparation to another wave.},

@article{Ramiaramanana.2021,
 abstract = {Flooding is currently one of the major threats to cities in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The demographic change caused by the high rate of natural increase, combined with the migration toward cities, leads to a strong demand for housing and promotes urbanization. Given the insufficiency or absence of adequate planning, many constructions are installed in flood-prone zones, often without adequate infrastructure, especially drainage systems. This makes them very vulnerable. Our research consists of carrying out a spatiotemporal analysis of the agglomeration of Antananarivo (Madagascar). It shows that urbanization leads to increased exposure of populations and constructions to floods. There is a pressure on land in flood-prone zones due to the exponential growth of the population at the agglomeration level. Some 32{\%} of the population of the Antananarivo agglomeration lived in flood-prone zones in 2018. An analysis of the evolution of built spaces from 1953 to 2017 highlights that urban expansion was intense over those years (6.1{\%} yearly increase of built areas). This expansion triggered the construction of built areas in flood-prone zones, which evolved from 399 ha in 1953 to 3675 ha in 2017. In 2017, 23{\%} of the buildings in the agglomeration, i.e., almost one out of every four buildings, were in flood-prone zones. A share of the urban expansion in flood-prone zones is related to informal developments that gather highly vulnerable groups with very little in terms of economic resources. Better integration of flood risk management in spatial planning policies thus appears to be an essential step to guide decisions so as to coordinate the development of urban areas and drainage networks in a sustainable way, considering the vulnerability of the population living in the most exposed areas.},

 abstract = {Many soil remote sensing applications rely on narrow-band observations to exploit molecular absorption features. However, broadband sensors are invaluable for soil surveying, agriculture, land management and mineral exploration, amongst others. These sensors provide denser time series compared to high-resolution airborne imaging spectrometers and hold the potential of increasing the observable bare-soil area at the cost of spectral detail. The wealth of data coming along with these applications can be handled using cloud-based processing platforms such as Earth Engine. We present a method for identifying the least-vegetated observation, or so called barest pixel, in a dense time series between January 1985 and March 2017, based on Landsat 5, 7 and 8 observations. We derived a Barest Pixel Composite and Bare Soil Composite for the agricultural area of the Swiss Plateau. We analysed the available data over time and concluded that about five years of Landsat data were needed for a full-coverage composite (90{\%} of the maximum bare soil area). Using the Swiss harmonised soil data, we derived soil properties (sand, silt, clay, and soil organic matter percentages) and discuss the contribution of these soil property maps to existing conventional and digital soil maps. Both products demonstrate the substantial potential of Landsat time series for digital soil mapping, as well as for land management applications and policy making.},

 abstract = {We describe a reference spatial database and four land use maps of Antananarivo city produced over 2017 reference year using a methodology combining machine learning and object based image analysis (OBIA). These maps are produced by processing satellite images using the Moringa land cover processing chain developed in our laboratory. We use a single very high spatial resolution (VHSR) Pleiades image, a time series of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images, a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and the aforementioned reference database. According to the Moringa workflow, the Pleiades image is used to generate a suitable object layer at VHSR using a segmentation algorithm. Each object is then classified using variables from the time series and information from the DTM. The reference database used to train the supervised classification algorithm is here described, as well as the 4 land cover maps produced at four different hierarchically nested nomenclature levels. For a number of classes going from 2 to 20, overall accuracies range from 94{\%} to 74{\%}. Such land cover products are very rare in Madagascar, so we have decided to make them openly accessible and usable by land managers and researchers.},

@article{Dupuy.2020b,
 abstract = {High urbanization rates in cities lead to rapid changes in land uses, particularly in southern cities where population growth is fast. Urban and peri-urban agricultural land is often seen as available space for the city to expand, but at the same time, agricultural land provides many benefits to cities pertaining to food, employment, and eco-services. In this context, there is an urgent need to provide spatial information to support planning in complex urban systems. The challenge is to integrate analysis of agriculture and urban land-cover classes, and of their spatial and functional patterns. This paper takes up this challenge in Antananarivo (Madagascar), where agricultural plots and homes are interlocked and very small. It innovates by using a methodology already tested in rural settings, but never applied to urban environments. The key step of the analysis is to produce landscape zoning based on multisource satellite data to identify agri-urban functional areas within the city, and to explore their relationships. Our results demonstrate that the proposed classification method is well suited for mapping agriculture and urban land cover (overall accuracy = 76.56{\%} for the 20 classes of level 3) in such a complex setting. The systemic analysis of urban agriculture patterns and functions can help policymakers and urban planners to design and build resilient cities.},

 abstract = {The Amazonian biome is important not only for South America but also for the entire planet, providing essential environmental services. The state of Rond{\^o}nia ranks third in deforestation rates in the Brazilian Legal Amazon (BLA) political division. This study aims to evaluate the land use/land cover (LULC) changes over the past ten years (2009-2019), as well as, to predict the LULC in the next 10 years, using TerrSet 18.3 software, in the state of Rond{\^o}nia, Brazil. The machine learning algorithms within the Google Earth Engine cloud-based platform employed a Random Forest classifier in image classifications. The Markov-CA deep learning algorithm predicted future LULC changes by comparing scenarios of one and three transitions. The results showed a reduction in forested areas of about 15.7{\%} between 2009 and 2019 in the Rond{\^o}nia state. According to the predictive model, by 2030, around 30{\%} of the remaining forests will be logged, most likely converted into occupied areas. The results reinforce the importance of measures and policies integrated with investments in research and satellite monitoring to reduce deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon and ensure the continuity of the Amazonian role in halting climate change.},

@article{Zhang.2020,
 abstract = {Madagascar, one of Earth's biodiversity hotpots, is characterized by heterogeneous landscapes and huge land cover change. To date, fine, reliable and timely land cover information is scarce in Madagascar. However, mapping high-resolution land cover map in the tropics has been challenging due to limitations associated with heterogeneous landscapes, the volume of satellite data used, and the design of methodology. In this study, we proposed an automatic approach in which the tile-based model was used on each tile (defining an extent of 1  1 as a tile) for mapping land cover in Madagascar. We combined spectral-temporal, textural and topographical features derived from all available Sentinel-2 observations (i.e., 11,083 images) on Google Earth Engine (GEE). We generated a 10-m land cover map for Madagascar, with an overall accuracy of 89.2{\%} based on independent validation samples obtained from a field survey and visual interpretation of very high-resolution (0.5--5 m) images. Compared with the conventional approach (i.e., the overall model used in the entire study area), our method enables reduce the misclassifications between several land cover types, including impervious land, grassland and wetland. The proposed approach demonstrates a great potential for mapping land cover in other tropical or subtropical regions.},
